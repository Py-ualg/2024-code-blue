# Algarve ground water monitoring

## 🚀 Motivation
Algarve and most of the Portugal is experiencing 10 years of droughts. [Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente][1] in Faro is responsible for monitoring the water

Below is the map of water levels of in west-coast aquifer, which shows that at some point it was 40cm from being contaminated by the sea water, which could have
unprecedented consequences for the 

## 🛠️ Tools

For public use, they are quite limited

1. Visualization in any automated plotting environment
2. Interpolation maps ()
3. API does not exist for the aquifer data, which are however publicly available (see [Data section](#data))
Here is Dario's great [compilation][2] of notebooks and materials to get you started with DL for chemmometrics.

## 🔦 Possible directions for the teams

1. Consumer systems are an unexplored territory. Disregarding the hardware (or not?), can you design a mobile app with classification of the fruit quality?
2. Dario can provide a curated training dataset, and you can experiment with architectures to achieve the best possible score on his hidden test data (Kaggle style)
3. Translate the QA techniques to other products, such as fish-markets in Algarve.
