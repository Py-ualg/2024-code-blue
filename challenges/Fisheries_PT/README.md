# Fisheries Monitoring and open Source Data

## 🚀 Motivation
Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) works with private as well as public data related to fisheries in Portugal.

## 🛠️ Tools

* TBC

## 🔦 Possible directions for the teams

1. Prediction and monitoring of the fisheries yields based on reports
2. Integrate several databases into a [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)][4] application to query diverse data.
3. How do PT fisheries compare to global standard, what can be improved, what monitoring and reporting is missing?
4. Seasonality and sustainability. Perhaps consumers should be aware of fish cycles to help sustainable fishing practices.

## 💾 Data

* IPMA [API for weather data][3]
