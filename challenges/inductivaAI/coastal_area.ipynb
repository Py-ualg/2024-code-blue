    "# Coastal Area simulation using SWASH with the Inductiva API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inductiva API provides an array of open source numerical simulators ready to use in the cloud, all from within Python code.\n",
    "A popular simulator related to Coastal Dynamics is SWASH, which we'll use to demonstrate a coastal area simulation using the Inductiva API.\n",
    "This simulation scenario consists of waves propagating in a coastal area represented by a bathymetric profile (i.e., the map of depths of the sea bottom as a function of spatial coordinates x, y). Waves are injected into the domain from one of the boundaries of the simulation with a given amplitude and period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows: first, we'll take a look at the input files required to run the simulation. We'll then run the simulation in Cloud machines, and then take a look at the output files.\n",

    "\n",
