# Code Blue Code of Conduct

## License and attribution

This Code of Conduct is distributed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike][4] license and it’s based on the [Pixel's camp Code of Conduct][3], [Citizen Code of Conduct][5] and [Rails Girls Summer of Code Code of Conduct][6].

## Purpose

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). All we care is talent and participation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in Code Blue hackathon to read these guidelines and help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Promoting a welcoming and inclusive environment

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to create and foster a welcoming and inclusive environment by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate authentically and actively. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before a conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. 
* Alert the Code Blue [organizers][7] if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event and community tools and forums.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify the Code Blue [organizers][7] or staff member as soon as possible. Staff members are easily identified in the venue.

Additionally, Code Blue organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Code Blue Organizers Contacts

You can reach the organization in many ways:

 * [E-mail][7]
 * Via staff members in the venue, they are easily identified.
