# Algae gene discovery

## 🚀 Motivation
[Necton][1], [GreenColab][2] and [MarBiotech][3] group at CCMAR are exploring ways to utilize micralgae as a food, feed, cosmetics, pharmaceutical compounds and energy source and CO2 sequester, perfect circular blue economy mix.

New deep-learning model for gene annotation has been proposed [here][4]. Unfortunately, there is no model working well for algae.

New genes identified means new links to functions, which can be used for species adaptation, product optimization using targeted mutation, strain and contamination classification.

## 🛠️ Tools
1. GitHub [repository][5] of Helixer with smoothly working example.
2. HelixerPost [repository][6] for output evaluation.


## 🔦 Possible directions for the teams
1. Develop model which first predicts well on this 
2. Test your model on other common variants.
3. Brainstorm with J Varela on Friday 18/10 session about other microalgae applications.

## 💾 Data
* Databank of genes, which fasta files serve as an input to the training phase.
