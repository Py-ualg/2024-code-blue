# SOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS: #
##########################

# - EFFORT DATA
#   - Can make maps for each year to see evolution of effort in the Atlantic - can make than as an automated process
#   - Can use the yearly maps above to create a video of the sequence of images/years over time
#   - Make maps for each fleet/country - can also be an automated process
#   - Make maps by quarter to see any trends
#   - use the Global Fishing Watch API to download satellite vessel tracking data and compare
#   - https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/
#   - ...

# - CATCH DATA
#   - Make plots for other species (database has 9 main species) - can use some automation code
#   - See where the different species occur (some more tropical and some more temperate)
#   - Explore if catches have some yearly and/or seasonal trends - can automate and make sequence of plots/videos
#   - Explore what fishing gears catch different species
#   - Boxplot of fishing gears is not working well. Think about the database structure and what needs to be processed before plotting, to understand the true catch of each fishing gear
